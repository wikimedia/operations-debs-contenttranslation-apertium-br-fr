Many many thanks to Tomaz Jacquet for allowing his FreeLang
dictionary of Breton--French to be used in the creation of 
this pair.

Thanks also to Jan Deloof who allowed the information from 
his Breton--Dutch dictionary to be used in extending the 
Breton morphological analyser.

This pair includes an extensive list of standardised toponyms 
very kindly donated by the Ofis ar Brezhoneg.

Terms have been extracted from both Wikipedia and Wiktionary, 
and automatically generated paradigms from Wiktionary provided
a basis of some of the entries in the morphological analyser.
